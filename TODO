Version 0.2.0
=============
* Specify hands on command line
* Option to output in csv for easy parsing
* Create self tests
* Move stable branch to master branch

Future
======
* Input multiple hands
* Read input from file (Merrit's idea)
* Wildcard support, eg: A?K? (or even AK) or ?? for a random hand
** What about stuff like AKs or AKo
* Omaha support
** How to handle wild cards in Omaha hands? Maybe use number? Eg: A1K1A2K2 would be AKAK double suited. Confusing for 9181A232
* Hand range support, eg: A?K?, A?A?, K?K? 
* Do away with include symlink to poker-eval headers
