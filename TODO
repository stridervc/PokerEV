* Optionally specify starting hands on command line
* Compilation instructions
* Don't like that you have to type '.' for no board, should just hit enter, but scanf won't allow this. Need to find a better way.
* Read input from file (Merrit's idea)
* Omaha support
** How to handle wild cards in Omaha hands? Maybe use number? Eg: A1K1A2K2 would be AKAK double suited. Confusing for 9181A232
* Wildcard support, eg: A?K? (or even AK) or ?? for a random hand
** What about stuff like AKs or AKo
* Hand range support, eg: A?K?, A?A?, K?K?, 88+
* Check math on split pots when more than two hands are involved
* Option to show stats with 1 card to come, if calculating from the flop
