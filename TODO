* Optionally specify starting hands on command line
* Compilation instructions
* Don't like that you have to type '.' for no board, should just hit enter, but scanf won't allow this. Need to find a better way.
* Add GPL info
* Read input from file (Merrit's idea)
* Start using version numbers
* Omaha support
* Wildcard support, eg: A?K? (or even AK) or ?? for a random hand
** What about stuff like AKs or AKo
* Hand range support, eg: A?K?, A?A?, K?K?
